# Layout

The Layout class is the basis for creating grids. It has functionality for converting between pixel and grid space and supports different orientations.

## Interface

```ts
class Layout {
    size: number;
    origin: Point;
    orientation: Orientation;
    constructor(orientation: "pointy" | "flat", size: number, origin?: Point);
    hexToPixel(hex: Hex): Point;
    pixelToHex(point: Point): Hex;
    hexWidth(): number;
    hexHeight(): number;
}
```

## Orientation

Layout supports two orientations, namely the "pointy" and the "flat" orientation.

<div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
    <Hexgrid orientation="pointy" />
    <Hexgrid orientation="flat" />
</div>

```ts
import { Layout } from '@lightvis/hexworld';

// Create pointy layout with size 20
const pointyLayout = new Layout("pointy", 20);

// Create flat layout with size 20
const flatLayout = new Layout("flat", 20);
```

## Pixel to hex

The pixel to hex conversion is useful for interactions. For instance it can be used to find the hex that the user is currently hovering.

```ts
// Retrieves a Hex object with the axial coordinates
const hex = layout.pixelToHex({ x: 100, y: 100 });
```

## Hex to pixel

The hex to pixel conversion is useful for drawing.

```ts
// Retrieves pixel coordinates (center) for a given hex
const pixel = layout.hexToPixel(new Hex(0, 0));
```
